# git-workshop
Demo repository for my Github Workshop

## Clone 
Checkout the Git Repository with the following command: 

`git clone https://github.com/TTH-Someone-stole-my-name/git-workshop.git`

## Commit 
After you have changed something, you have to take 3 steps in order to add files to the repository: 
1. Add the files you want to commit with the `git add <path>` command. 
2. Commit the file with the `git commit -m <Commit Message>` command. 
3. Push your changes to the server using: `git push

##Branching
Branching is one of the core elements of Git. It allows you to create your own branches and work on them independent of the rest of the repository. 
If you never change your branch, you simply stick with the default branch: `master`. So in Git you are always working on a branch. 

You can branch of any valid point within the Git repository, allowing for maximum flexibility. Of course there is also a way to merge branches back together. 
And no surprise, that feature is called: `git merge`
